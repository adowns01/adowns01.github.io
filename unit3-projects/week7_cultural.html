		<h3>Revisiting "Affirming your Values"</h3>

		<p>In my post about <a href = "http://adowns01.github.io/unit1-projects/week2_cultural_blog.html">affirming my values</a>, I wrote about the following four values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adventure</li>
			<li>Autonomy </li>
			<li>Confidence </li>
			<li>Independence </li>
		</ul>

		<p>In my <a href = "http://adowns01.github.io/unit2-projects/week6_cultural.html">blog post about stereotype threat</a> I wrote about my experiences in male dominated fields. I think the values I listed above are important to me (especially confidence) because those are the values that I try to use when I feel the effects of stereotype threat.</p> 

		<p>When I am feeling down at DBC, I hope that I will feel safe around my peers so that I can turn to them for comfort or help.</p>
