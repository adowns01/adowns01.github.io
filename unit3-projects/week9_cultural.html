		<h3>My Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>

		<img src = "images/thinking_styles.jpg">

		<p>According to the <a href = "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc thinking style quiz</a> I am nearly <strong>50% Concrete Sequential and 50% Abstract Sequential</strong>, with almost none of the other two thinking styles.</p>

		<h4>The Concrete Sequential items that resonate most with me are:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I like clear, predictable instructions</li>
			<li>I learn best in a structured environment</li>
			<li>I find it hard to work in groups</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When I decided that I wanted to learn more programming, my choice was between staying 2 extra years in college to get a 3rd major in computer science or going to a bootcamp like DBC. <strong>I never even considered trying to do it on my own.</strong> Though the thought did cross my mind, I knew it wouldn't work for me. I really like a structured environment. I like learning from someone. </p>

		<p>Working in groups is not my favorite; I've known this for a long time. It might seem weird to an outsider then that I would chose DBC, which focuses so much on pairing. My problems with group work is that my group members and I were never taught how to work together productively. (Don't think that I am just blaming the other group members, I was horrible to work with as well.) DBC has trained us on how to be a good pair, which has really changed my feelings on group projects. </p>


		<h4>The Abstract Sequential items that resonate most with me are:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I like applying logic to finding solutions</li>
			<li>I learn best when I have access to experts</li>
			<li>I find "sentimental" thinking hard</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I am excited to start DBC where I will have access to experts not only in our teachers, but also the easy access to my peers who I know will help me a lot!</p>

		<h4>My Strategies </h4>

		<p>Most of my conscious effort has been to make sure that I am a good partner. I have a tendency to interrupt people when I get an idea. It's not personal, I swear! But I know that I hate being interrupted because it makes me feel like the other person isn't listening to me. So I've been implementing the following strategies to listen better and make sure my partners feels listened to:</p> 
		<ul>
			<li>No interrupting!</li>
			<li>Seriously, no interrupting</li>
			<li>If you don't understand an idea, ask your partner to repeat it and explain further rather than dismissing it </li>
			<li>Ask for help from your partner before turning to google</li>
		</ul>
