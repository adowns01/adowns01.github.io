		<h3>The DBC Culture and Me</h3>

		<img src = "images/SF.jpg">
		
		<p>One of the reasons that I chose to apply to DBC over other similar programs was DBC's focus on things that aren't coding. I like the idea of the focus on engineering empathy and working together.</p> 

		<p>In school I did nearly all my programming alone. If I worked with anyone, it wasn't truly pairing, it was more doing our own thing side by side, and asking for help when we got yet another compiling error and helping each other find that missing semi-colon.</p> 

		<p>I always thought that if I wanted something to be done quickly I should lock myself alone in a room for a few hours and pile though it. Part of this was my own arrogance, but part of it was also that we were never fought how to pair while coding.</p> 

		<p>I acknowledged this weakness before I even applied to DBC and I am looking forward to pushing my own envelope at DBC.</p>
