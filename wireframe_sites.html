	<h3><a href="http://groupthink.jezebel.com/" target= "_blank">Groupthink</a> Homepage Wireframe</h3>
	<p><strong>What problem is this web page solving?</strong></p>
	<p>With Groupthink you will never be bored at work again and you have a community to support you.</p>
	<p><strong>What visual challenges are there?</strong></p>
	<p>My least favorite part of the design is that there are two logos at the top, one full and one cropped. Also, the two circles near the top are for navigation and they could easily be combined. Overall the site is cluttered.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://Bookriotcom/" target= "_blank">Bookriot</a> Homepage Wireframe</h3>
	<p><strong>What problem is this web page solving?</strong></p>
	<p>Bookriot introduces readers to new books, authors, genres, podcasts, and other literary things.</p>
	<p><strong>What visual challenges are there?</strong></p>
	<p>The blog post previews on the homepage are way too big. I can barely see multiple previews at once- and I have a large screen.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://codecademy.com/" target= "_blank">Codecademy<a/> Homepage Wireframe</h3>
	<p><strong>What problem is this web page solving?</strong></p>
	<p>Codecademy helps people begin to learn how to code in many languages.</p>
	<p><strong>What visual challenges are there?</strong></p>
	<p>I love this site; I think it is beautiful and intuitive. I have no problems with the design.</p>
