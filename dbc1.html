	<h2>The Basics</h2>

	<h3>My job</h3>
	<p>I currently work at a web development as a project manager. It's the first job I've had where I'm ordering people to do things rather than doing them myself, which is hard to get used to. I do a lot of QA for websites, so even though I can't build a nice website (yet) I heavily critique others. </p>
	<h4>My hobbies</h4>
	<p>I have a feeling that with this prep my hobby time is going to go out the window, but that's okay, I knew that when I signed up. So these are my now-past hobbies: 
		<ol>
			<li>dancing</li>
			<li>reading</li>
		</ol>
	... <br/>
	...okay that's about it. But I <strong>love</strong> those two things a lot. </p>
	<h5>My favorites</h5>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/" target = "_blank">Podcast</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.jasperfforde.com/" target = "_blank">Author</a></li>
