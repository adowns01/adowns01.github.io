	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>I have a feeling that with this prep my hobby time is going to go out the window, but that's okay, I knew that when I signed up. So these are my now-past hobbies: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>dancing</li>
				<li>reading</li>
			</ol>
		<p>...okay that's about it. But I <strong>love</strong> those two things <em>a lot</em>. </p>
