		<p class = "poem_title">To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl</p>
		<p>Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon</p>
		<p>	on the day you were born,</p>
		<p>you would be all done in only one more year?</p>
		<p>Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone.</p>
		<p>So never mind; you're fine just being yourself.</p>
		<p>You're loved for just being you.</p>
		<p>But did you know that at your age</p>
		<p>Judy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture,</p>
		<p>Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory</p>
		<p>and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room</p>
		<p>-no wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?</p>
		<p>Of course, there will be time for all that later in your life,</p>
		<p>after you come out of your room and begin to blossom,</p>
		<p>or at least pick up all your socks.</p>
		<p>For some reason I keep remembering that</p>
		<p>Lady Jane Grey was queen of England when she was only 15.</p>
		<p>But then she was beheaded,</p>
		<p>so never mind her as a role model.</p>
		<p>A few centuries later, when he was your age,</p>
		<p>Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family,</p>
		<p>but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies,</p> 
		<p>four operas and two complete masses as a youngster.</p>
		<p>But of course, that was in Austria at the height of Romantic lyricism,</p>
		<p>not here in the suburbs of Cleveland.</p>
		<p>Frankly, who cares if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15</p>
		<p>or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?</p>
		<p>We think you're special just being you -</p>
		<p>playing with your food and staring into space.</p>
		<p>By the way, I lied about Schubert doing the dishes,</p>
		<p>but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house.</p>
