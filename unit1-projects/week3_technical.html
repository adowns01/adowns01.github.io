		<h3>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h3>
		<p>JavaScript allows websites to be interactive! Things can move, information can update, and pop-ups can pop-up! Or in technical terms, it can make a website <em>dynamic</em>.</p> 

		<ul>
			<li>Do you want the current date and time on your webpage? Use JavaScript.</li> 
			<li>Do you want a pop-up to annoy your viewers every 10 seconds? Use JavaScript. </li>
			<li>Do you want a secure on-screen keyboard? Use JavaScript. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Besides the fact that it can make your webpage awesome (or <a href="http://kilianvalkhof.com/2011/javascript/annoying-js-how-to-be-an-asshole/">really annoying</a>) here are some other great things about JS:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It works on every major browser.</li>
			<li>You don't compile it.</li>
			<li>It's high level (looks more like english and less like binary), so it's easy to learn, even for people who have never coded before.</li>
		</ul>
