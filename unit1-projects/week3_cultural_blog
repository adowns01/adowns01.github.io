	<h3>Thoughts on Pairing</h3>
	<p>Going into this, I was really nervous about pairing. I had never truly coded in a pair, I had only worked on group projects that contained coding, none of which were good experiences. That’s why I was so surprised with how natural pair coding felt to me. It’s nice to have one person thinking about the bigger picture while the other person is thinking about the details.</p>

	<p>All of my pairing were smooth sailing code-wise (with great sound affects curtsey of Greg), except for one. We hit a major roadblock. We had gotten a lot of our js syntax confused and basically had to re-write everything after we thought we were done. But we worked together and fixed it. Because we had to overcome a problem together, that pairing was the most rewarding.</p>

	<p>Nothing has been frustrating yet, but I am still nervous about pairing on larger projects.</p>

	<h3>Thoughts on Feedback</h3>

	<p>I don’t have any feedback yet, so I can’t speak on it yet. But since I know that everyone is giving everyone else feedback I have been more conscious in pairing sessions, making sure that I don’t try to be both driver and navigator. So even though I haven’t gotten any direct feedback yet, the threat of it has improved me. </p>

	<p>It’s still difficult for me to write feedback. As a woman, I feel like I have been socialized be nice and never say anything bad, even in a constructive way. I writing feedback will become more natural over time. </p>
