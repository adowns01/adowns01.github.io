	<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
	<p><strong>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</strong></p>
	<p>Adventure, autonomy, confidence, and independence.</p>
	

	<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
	<p><strong>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</strong></p>
	<p>I have only worked in male-dominated fields, and I have often felt like I wasn't being taken seriously because of my gender. To suceed and thrive I needed to have a lot of confidence in my work and in myself. I think it has made me a stronger person and will serve me well in the future. </p>
