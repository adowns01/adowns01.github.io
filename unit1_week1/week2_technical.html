		<h3>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h3>
		<p> I think it's easier to think of these terms in relationship to a photograph.</p>
		<img src="images/photo_frame.png" style= "width: 50%">
		
		<p> The <strong>margin</strong> is located outside of the object itself and it regulates how close other objects can get to it. In terms of my metaphor, it is the space on the wall between the photo and everything else hanging on the wall. Without a margin the photos (or their frames) would be flush. </p>

		<p>The <strong>border</strong> is the frame, it outlines the object and adds to its width and height. Just as there are different kinds of frames, there are different kinds of borders.You have a choice of solid, dashed, and more.</p>

		<p><strong>Padding</strong> is the mat. It is the space between the content (the photo) and the border (the frame).</p>

		<h3>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
		<p>Objects can have multiple <strong>classes</strong> and one <strong>class</strong> can be used on multiple objects.</p>
		<p>Objects can only have one <strong>id</strong> and a specific <strong>id</strong> can only be used once per page. Ids are ideal for headers and footers.</p>

		<h3>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h3>
		<p><strong>Relative positioning</strong> moves an object a specified distance from where it would normally fall. For instance. If a square had relative positioning and "right: 100px" then it would move to the right 100px from where it normally would have fallen.</p>
		<p><strong>Absolute positioning</strong> is relative to the whole page. So if a square had absolute positioning and "right:100px" it would appear 100px from the right handside of the screen.</p>
		<p><strong>Fixed positioning</strong> is relative to the browser. So if a square had fixed positioning and is "top; 100px" then regardless of scrolling, the item would always appear 100px from the top of your browser.</p>

		<h3>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h3>
		<p><strong>Inline</strong> elements go with the flow of the website; they don't start on a new line. Some elements are automatically inline, like bolding or italicising. When an item is <strong>bolded</strong> it doesn't start on a new line from the other words in the sentence. When an item is inline, you can't specify or height or width for it.</p>
		<p><strong>Inline-block</strong> elements <em>can</em> have height and width values and still goes with the flow of the website.</p>
