		<h3>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h3>
		<p> I think it's easier to think of these terms in relationship to a photograph.</p>
		<img src="images/photo_frame.png" style= "width: 50%">
		
		<p> The <strong>margin</strong> is located outside of the object itself and it regulates how close other objects can get to it. In terms of my metaphor, it is the space on the wall between the photo and everything else hanging on the wall. Without a margin the photos (or their frames) would be flush. </p>

		<p>The <strong>border</strong> is the frame, it outlines the object and adds to its width and height. Just as there are different kinds of frames, there are different kinds of borders.You have a choice of solid, dashed, and more.</p>

		<p><strong>Padding</strong> is the mat. It is the space between the content (the photo) and the border (the frame).</p>

		<div class="code">
			<p>img {</p>
			<p>     margin: 10px;</p>
			<p>     border-style: solid;</p>
			<p>     border-color: black;</p>
			<p>		padding: px; </p>
			<p>}</p>
