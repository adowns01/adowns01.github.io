		<h3>Object Oriented Design vs. Functional Design</h3>

		<h4>What Is Object-Oriented Programming?</h4> 

		<p>I heard about Object Oriented Programming long before I know what it was. My CS-major friends would talk about it and I often saw it on the list of requirements for jobs I applied to. I didn't know what it was, I just knew that I didn't know how to do it. I built it up in my mind, so by the time we actually covered it in my C++ class, I was shocked by how *not* complicated the topic actually is.</p>

		<p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> is programming that uses objects (like classes) to design programs. Some benefits to OOP are: </p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Makes the program easier to read</li>
				<li>It keeps unrelated data separate.</li>
				<li>It is easier to update code.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>For example here is a cat and a polygon not in classes:</p> 

		<p class = "code">cat_name = "Jason Paw-lick" </br>
		cat_age = 2</br></br>

		def meow(name)</br>
		&nbsp;puts "#{name} says meow"</br>
		end</br></br>

		polygon_type = "Hexagon"</br>
		polygon_sides = 6</br></br>

		def print_sides (sides)</br>
		&nbsp;puts "I have #{sides} sides."</br>
		end</br></p>

		<p>But because they are not encapsulated in objects I can start doing some weird things that don't make sense. For example:</p> 

		<p class = "code">meow(polygon_type)<comment> #=> "Hexagon says meow"</comment></br></br>

		print_sides(cat_age)<comment> #=> "I have 2 sides."</comment></br></p>

		<p>Neither of those makes sense. A polygon can't meow (sadly) and Jason Paw-lick the cat has more than 2 sides.</p> 

		<p>If these items were classes, these mishaps wouldn't be possible. For example:</p> 

		<p class = "code">class Cat</br>
		&nbsp;def initialize(name, age)</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;@name = name</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;@age = age</br>
		&nbsp;end</br></br>

		&nbsp;def meow</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "#{@name} says meow"</br>
		&nbsp;end</br>

		end </br></br>

		class Polygon</br>
		&nbsp;def initialize (type, sides)</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;@type = type </br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;@sides = sides</br>
		&nbsp;end</br></br>

		&nbsp;def print_sides</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "I have #{@sides} sides."</br>
		&nbsp;end</br>

		end</br></p>

		<p>Now that these two objects are in totally different classes so you can't program a polygon to meow or a cat to have a certain number of sides.</p> 

		<h4>What is Functional Programming?</h4>

		<p>Unlike OOP, I had not heard of functional programming before reading this blog post prompt.</p> 

		<p><strong>Functional Programming (FP)</strong> is when functions (not objects) are the building blocks of the program. Specifically, very short concise functions. FP also doesn't believe in changing values once they have been assigned.</p>  

		<h4>Don't update, create.</h4>

		<p>Once a variable is created. Don't change it. If you have to change it, just create a new variable. For example:</p> 


		<p class = "code">
			<comment># Don't do this </comment></br>
			nums = [1,2]</br>
			nums << [3,4]</br>
			nums <comment>#=> [1,2,3,4]</br></br>

			# Do this instead</comment></br>
			nums = [1,2]</br>
			more_nums = [nums] + [3,4]</br>
			more_nums  <comment>#=> [1,2,3,4]</comment></br>
		</p>

		<h4>So, what's better?</h4>

		<p>I only have experience with OOP, so I am very biased. But in general my response is:</p>
