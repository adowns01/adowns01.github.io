		<h3> Women in Tech </h3>
		<p>As someone who has only recently found an interest in joining the tech world, I have no authority to speak on the problems that face it. However, I do have the authority to talk about problems that plague STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) fields in general.</p>

		<p><strong>There are not enough women in STEM fields, especially in high positions.</strong></p>

		<p>Before embarking on this DBC journey I worked as a physicist and in college I studied physics and math, both heavily male dominated areas. At the beginning of my college career the gender gap was less noticeable because the classes were larger and more general. But as I progressed, it was hard to ignore that I was often one of few, if not the only woman in a class of 20-30. </p>

		<h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
		<img src = "http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/how_it_works.png">

		<p><strong>I don't speak for my gender.</strong> As the only woman in a class I feel that when people judge me they judge my gender. I don't want to ask a question that would make me seem dumb, because I don't want to enforce the stereotype that women aren't good at science/math. Because of this, I rarely asked questions in class during college.</p> 

		<p><strong>Impostor syndrome sucks.</strong> Impostor syndrome is the incorrect feeling that you are a fraud and your successes are due to luck not your skills and it's <a href = "https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor">keeping women out of STEM fields</a>.  When I was conducting my own physics research I constantly felt like a fraud, which kept me from ever publishing my work. Other women who have had impostor syndrome include: World Health Organization chief Dr. Margaret Chan and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. </p>

		<h4>How do we change it?</h4>

		<p><strong>Talking about it is important.</strong> Hey, you made it this far in my blog post, congrats. One of the reasons that I like DBC is because of the focus they have put on engineering empathy and ending the gender gap. Believe me, if you are in the SF cohort you will hear me talk about this a lot more.</p>

		<p><strong>Action is more important.</strong> Talk is nice, but action is more important. For instance, as a woman, I got a discount on DBC. I think this is a good way to attract and encourage women. However, my cohort is only about 10% women, which is lower than computer science undergraduate degrees where women were about <a href = "http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/BytheNumbers09.pdf">18% of degree recipients in 2010.</a></p>

		<p>Here are some ways I try to combat this problem:
			<ul>
				<li>Create/attend/support women STEM groups </li>
				<li>Speak up if someone says something problimatic</li>
				<li>Mentor and encourage women</li>
				<li>Continue to discuss this issue</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
