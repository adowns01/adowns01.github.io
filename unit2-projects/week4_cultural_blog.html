		<h3>Week 4 Cultural Blog: The Compass of Shame</h3>

		<img src = "images/compassofshame.png">

		<p>Regarding the <a href = "http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf"> Compass of Shame </a>I am definitely between a withdrawal and an attack self person. Though, my mind does get snarky and I sometimes am known to attack others, but only non-violently in my mind.</p>

		<p>I have been raised to avoid conflict and to smooth everything over my whole life. Thus most of the conflict in my life died with a whimper, not a bang, mostly from me just avoiding it. </p>
		<p>I have moved a lot, <em>a lot</em>, which makes avoidance really easily. For instance, many issues with friends, I would just push the problem out of my mind until I moved again and then I would never talk to them again.</p> 
		<p>I would say my actions never made the situation better or worse. I always think that if I confront a situation that it would be worse. I would rather just fade into oblivion and then eventually de-friend them on Facebook, then actually confront them.</p>
		<p>I wouldn't change anything because I still hate conflict and I still think that what came between me and these people injured our friendships beyond repair.</p> 
		<p>In the future, I don't want to move as much as I have in my past. I actually want to live somewhere for more than a year (please, moving-gods, please). I have always known this time in my life is coming and I am worried that my defense mechanisms won't work when I live somewhere long term.</p>
