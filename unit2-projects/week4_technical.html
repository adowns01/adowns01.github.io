		<h3>Week 4 Technical Blog: What is <em>Enumerable#group_by?</em></h3>

		<p>Let's start at the beginning.</p>

		<p><em>Enumerable</em> is a way to describe a class that can iterate through all of its elements. For example an array is enumerable, while strings and integers are not enumerable. So Enumerable#group_by means that this function is only valid for enumerable classes.</p>

		<p>The hashtag, indicated that this is a public method. This means that you call if using dot notation. For instance:</p>

		<p class = "code">my_array = [1,2,3]<br>
		my_array.group_by{#stuff goes here}</p>

		<p>The purpose of <em>Enumerable#group_by?</em> is to sort objects by a certain parameter. For example you could sort numbers by if they are even or odd by seeing if they are divisible by 2:</p>

		<p class = "code">my_array = [9,4,6,8,10,2,3] <br>
		my_array.group_by{|element| element % 2} <br>
		#=>{1=>[9, 3], 0=>[4, 6, 8, 10, 2]}</p>

		<p>Or you could sort words in a sentence by length:</p>

		<p class = "code">my_array = ["I", "cannot", "wait", "to", "attend", "DBC", "!!!"]<br>
		my_array.group_by{|element| element.length}<br>
		{1=>["I"], 6=>["cannot", "attend"], 4=>["wait"], 2=>["to"], 3=>["DBC", "!!!"]}</p>
