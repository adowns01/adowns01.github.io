		<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>

		<p>The <strong>stereotype threat</strong> is the phenomenon that when a person is reminded of a stereotype about themselves, then they are more likely to preform like that stereotype. For example, if Black person is reminded that Blacks often preform worse than their white peers right before a test, then the Black person will do worse.</p>

		<p>As a woman who studied physics and math in college I am well aware of the stereotype threat. Every time I walked into a classroom I was very aware that I was one of few, if not the only, woman in the class. I was reminded that I am a woman when the professors asked me only the easy questions or when I walked into a magnetics lab and the professor asked if I was prepared enough to be there (I was), but he didn't ask my male partner (he wasn't) or when my male peers told me they didn't like my homework solutions because my proofs were too feminine (what does that even mean!??).</p> 

		<p>When I talk about these problems with men (<a href = "http://time.com/79357/not-all-men-a-brief-history-of-every-dudes-favorite-argument/" target = "_blank">not all men!</a>), they often ask why I don't confront the situation. I try to, I do. But it is exhausting and alienating when I confront people constantly. Plus, in a school setting, I don't want my peers to dislike me because I often needed their help and I don't want my professors to dislike me because they grade me. </p>

		<p>My solution is to go to areas that have more women, where I was represented. My advisor was the only female professor in the department and all of the female physics students (all 3 of us) worked in her lab. I petitioned the department to fund women in physics club and met with undergrads and grads alike once a week.</p> 

		<p>I think the best way to have an open work environment is to make sure that everyone is represented and that everyone feels safe to bring up issues.</p> </br></br></br></br>
