		<ol>
		<li>Groupthink is a shared blog which is part of Jezebel which is part of Kinja which is part of Gawker Media. I like GroupThink because it's full of like minded people (feminists who love lentils and Benedict Cumberbatch) and there are few trolls. It's the only place on the internet where I find the majority of comments kind and insightful.</li> </br>

		<li>My eye is first drawn to the top blog post. As I stand back I get distacrted by the sidebar which has a list of popular posts and it puts of picture on top that is not necessarily related to the top post listed. This is very aggrivating because I don't find the sidebar useful and it takes up a lot of room on the screen. </li></br>

		<li>The website looks messy, confusing, over-complicated, plain, and dull.</li></br>

		<li>Groupthink is just a place for people to get together and talk about things that interest them often with a lot of gifs.</li></br>

		<li>The content is silly, supportive, Cumberbatch-filled, interesting, feminist. I don't think it matches the look of the website at all.</li></br>

		<li>It's a blog so it's easy to navigate around the site on a basic level. If you are searching for a particular story or comment it's nearly impossible because the search is very bad.</li></br>

		<li>It's easy to browse the stories (but you will never read them all- there are 100+ posts per day), but it's hard to read the comments- the most important part. Now they initally show "highlighted" images, which are the most popular ones. However, it mixes them up  chronologically and takes them out of the comment conversations they were made in so they don't typically make sense.</li></br>

		<li>I feel like I had a conversation with a good friend.</li></br>

		<li>It does not sell anything.</li></br>

		<li>It gives me ideas for what books I want to read next.</li> </br>

		<li>The featured blog post. It's pretty much the only thing I can see because it's so big. It is the most important thing, but I wish everything were smaller so I could see more.</li></br>

		<li>The website is large, blocky, photographic, unaligned, and bold.</li></br>

		<li>The website is a blog about books and bookish things. It helps book lovers read content that interests them.</li></br>

		<li>The content is literary, lighthearted, promotional, click-bait-y, and list-filled. I think it matches it's website well.</li></br>

		<li>It's easy to view the content in chronological order, or to find different tags, but if you're looking for a specific article the search doesn't work well. The menu and sidebar are utilized well so the site is easy to navigate.</li></br>

		<li>There is way too much content to browse through everything. They don't have a list of their recurring articles either so its hard to find specific ones if you don't know exactly what you are looking for.</li></br>

		<li>A little overwhelmed; it makes me feel like there are so many books I want to read and not near enough time.</li></br>

		<li>It does not sell anything.</li></br>

		<ol>
			<li>I used Codecademy a lot when I was trying to learn how to program by myself. I found it well written and easy to follow.</li></br>

			<li>My eye is first drawn to the computer in the center/right of the screen. In the computer you can programming very quickly and it shows how easy it can be. I think this is a good area to emphasize because it will get people who are just thinking about joining feeling confident and more liking to begin learning. </li></br>

			<li>I would describe the Codecademy website as: dark, clean, modern, organized, sleek </li></br>
			
			<li>Codecademy helps people learn programming on their own with tutorials. You can learn the basics of many languages including: ruby, html, css, javascript, python, php, and more.</li></br>
			
			<li>I would describe the content/focus/purpose on Codecademy as: educational, well-written, fun, self-motivating, silly. I think that the Codecademy website matches their content.</li></br>
			
			<li>The website is very well organized and it is very easy to find what you are looking for from the homepage or any other page.</li></br>
			
			<li>You can't browse all of the material because you have to complete each section before moving to the next. However, it is easy to look at all of the available languages and tutorials that they have available.</li></br>
			
			<li>After using Codecademy I feel more confident about my programming abilities.</li></br>
			
			<li>Codecademy does not sell anything.</li></br>
